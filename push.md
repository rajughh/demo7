[4:44 pm, 9/7/2024] Meta AI: To push a branch remotely in Git, you can use the following command:

git push <remote_name> <branch_name>

Here, <remote_name> is the name of the remote repository you want to push to, and <branch_name> is the name of the branch you want to push.

For example, if you want to push the feature/new-feature branch to the origin remote repository, you can use the following command:

git push origin feature/new-feature

If you want to set the upstream tracking information for the branch, you can use the -u option:

git push -u origin feature/new-feature

This will set the upstream tracking information for the branch, so that future pushes and pulls will be done against the same remote branch.

You can also use the --set-upstream option instead of -u:

git push --set-upstream origin feature/new-feature

Note that if you want to push a new branch to a remote repository, you need to use the -u option to set the upstream tracking information. If you don't use the -u option, the branch will be created on the remote repository, but it will not be tracked by Git.
